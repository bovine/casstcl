* make sure UTF-8 support is correctly handled

	Is Cassandra all UTF-8 or are some types not?  Is there anything we need
	to do for it to work?

* create a demonstration that uses SSL for the connection to the cassandra cluster (the Tcl/C interface has interfaces to their slightly lame SSL setup calls.  Use them to create the demo.)

	The interfaces are there but they take the arguments as strings.  It'll need some scaffolding to get files from the right plances into the right calls.  A demo will show connecting over SSL to a cluster and document that.

* allow where the cassandra cpp-driver library is located to be specified rather than assuming it is in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib

* maybe detect if tcl isn't built with threads and stop because cassandra doesn't work with threads

* support the following data types in casstcl_cass_value_to_tcl_obj:
	* custom
	* decimal
	* inet
	* varint
	* timeuuid

* support batches, probably with a batch method and suboptions
	$cass batch start
	$cass batch add $statement
	$cass batch add $statement
	$cass batch exec
	$cass batch drop

  on the other hand batches can be done entirely through CQL.

  also if supported there is some argument about how securely
  for the write to have been completed for it to be considered
  complete.

* see if the way we get column names and data types in select is inefficient and if so then only get the that info once and keep a copy of it during the select, freeing it afterwards

* Figure out what's going on with https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!topic/cpp-driver-user/qswjKhATEKU
